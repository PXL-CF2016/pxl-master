This repo is for our open source Python/Javascript project that allows users 
to manipulate an LED reader board wirelessly using a Raspberry Pi 3 and a 
32x128 LED matrix.

# Description
The result of this project would be a programmable LED reader board that 
users can access and interact with through a website and user interface 
that allows full reader board control. On the back-end, users would have 
accounts from which upon login, could manipulate the board and save 
customized preferences for what they like to show on the reader.
